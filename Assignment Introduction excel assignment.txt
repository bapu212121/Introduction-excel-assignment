Question 2)

The Table below contains percipitation measurments as measured in the Rochester NY area last year.		
We sampled 3 days in each of the first three months of 2018:		
Sample	Month	Rainfall (mm)
Sample 1	Jan-18	152
Sample 2	Jan-18	171
Sample 3	Jan-18	110
Sample 4	Feb-18	173
Sample 5	Feb-18	128
Sample 6	Feb-18	107
Sample 7	Mar-18	213
Sample 8	Mar-18	238
Sample 9	Mar-18	131
		
What was the average precipitation for each month?		
		
Jan-18		
Feb-18		
Mar-18		
		
		
Now, calculate the average of the following numbers only with formulas SUM and COUNT (don't use Average formula)		
		
What is the average of all of the samples?		
Now get the same result with Average function		
		
"Question 2) The excel file named Average 3, the table below contains precipitation
measurement as measured in the Rochester NY area last year and we
sampled 3 days in each of the first three months of 2018. Complete all
the question in the file given."		
		
Answers are below		
1. Answer) Jan - 18 average  		
For Sum		
433		
For Count		
3		
Average = Sum / Count		
144.3333333		
		
2.Answer) Fab-18 average		
For Sum		
408		
For Count		
3		
Average = Sum / Count		
136		
		
3.Answer) March-18 average		
For Sum		
582		
For Count		
3		
Average = Sum / Count		
194		
		
4) What is the average of all of the samples?		
For Sum		
1423		
For Count		
9		
Average = Sum / Count		
158.1111111		
		
5) Now get the same result with Average function		
158.1111111		

Question 3) count 1

The table below shows survey responses; the respondents could use any value for their answers.

Solve by using COUNT and COUNTA formulas, and use only column B (Grey) to answer the questions:	
	
Question	How many numerical (with numbers only) responses are in the range?
Answer - when we use count formula only numerical value counts. Answer of count is 4.	4
	
Question	How many responses in total are in the range?
Answer - for total range we use countA formula, answer is 7	7

Question 4)Count 2

The following table represents a bank statement of ExcelMaster company.

114	Pound - Egyptian banknotes	0
		
Answer by using functions COUNT and COUNTA		
Question	How many numerical answers appear in column C - Amount?	
Answer - We can use only count formula for get answer. Answer is 10	10

Formula =COUNT(C4:C17)	
		
	COUNT returns the number of cells with a number.	
		
		
Question	How many non-blank answers (numbers and letters) appear in column C?	
Answer - We can use CountA formula answer is 12	

Formula = COUNTA(C4:C17)

Question 5) Count 3

	Answer using the following range:
	
	
	Orange
	4
	
	3
	
	L
	
	#DIV/0!
	AAA
	Apple1234
	
	Solve by using formulas COUNT, COUNTA and COUNTBLANK:
	
1	How many cells with a number value are in the grey range (cells B3 to B13)?
ANSWER IS 2 (FORMULA IS  COUNT(B3:B13)	
	2
	
2	How many empty cells are in the grey range?
Aneswe is 4  ( COUNTBLANK(B3:B13))	
4	
3	How many non number cells are in  the grey range?
Answer is 9 (Formula is ROWS(B3:B13) - COUNT(B3:B13)	
9	
4	How many cells in total are in the range?
Answer is 11	
Formula is ( ROWS(B3:B13)	
	11

Question 7) Hlookup

7) In excel file named HLOOKUP, solve all the question using
HLOOKUP only

1	What is the department of employee with ID 102?										
											
	Enter function here: Formula(HLOOKUP(D3,B3:K5,3,FALSE))	Marketing	Formula(HLOOKUP(D3,B3:K5,3,FALSE)) ->	Marketing							
											
2	What is the salary of employee with ID 105?										
											
	Enter function here: Formula (HLOOKUP(G3,B3:L6,4,FALSE)	70000	HLOOKUP(G3,B3:L6,4,FALSE)	           ->      70000							
											
											
3	What is the total pay of employee with ID 107? 										
	Enter function here: Formula (HLOOKUP(I3,B3:L8,6,FALSE))	85000	Formula (HLOOKUP(I3,B3:L8,6,FALSE))  =>	  85000							


Question 8) IF 1	

Table A contains names and their respective grades for Excel 101 Course			
Complete column C using only IF formula			
Grade 60 or higher = Pass			
Grade less than 60 = Fail

Beni	55	Fail	IF(B8>=60,"Pass","Fail")
Charlie	15	Fail	IF(B9>=60,"Pass","Fail")
Dani	60	Pass	IF(B10>=60,"Pass","Fail")


Question 8) IF 2


The following table is an extract from an accounting system that contains four journal entries				
Check if column A's cells match column B's cell				
if they match - return "match", otherwise return "no match"				
				
	A	B		
	Debit	Credit	Same value?	Formula
Journal Entry 1	$94.00 	$94.00 	match	IF(B7=C7,"match","not match")
Journal Entry 2	$109.00 	$109.00 	match	IF(B8=C8,"match","not match")
