Module 2) Introduction to Excel - Assignment

QUSETION 1 )
 Use the average function and calculate the average of all the three
category of weight. (for this question use excel file named average 1).


	Category	Name	Weight
	Light Weight	A	43
	Light Weight	B	59
	Light Weight	C	72

	Use only Average function for the following excercises		
			
1	Average Weight of "Light Weight" category		58
			
2	Average Weight of "Medium Weight" category		162
			
3	Average Weight of "Heavey Weight" category		389
			
4	Average for all categories 		203
		
			
			
Answer			
1 Answer	Average Weight of "Light Weight" category   is     58  ( =AVERAGE(D4:D6)_		
2.Answer	Average Weight of "Medium Weight" category  is     162	(=AVERAGE(D7:D9))	
3.Answer	Average Weight of "Heavey Weight" category  is     389	(=AVERAGE(D10:D12))	
4.Answer	Average for all categories  is 		           203   (=AVERAGE(D4:D12))

Question 2)

The Table below contains percipitation measurments as measured in the Rochester NY area last year.		
We sampled 3 days in each of the first three months of 2018:		
Sample	Month	Rainfall (mm)
Sample 1	Jan-18	152
Sample 2	Jan-18	171
Sample 3	Jan-18	110
Sample 4	Feb-18	173
Sample 5	Feb-18	128
Sample 6	Feb-18	107
Sample 7	Mar-18	213
Sample 8	Mar-18	238
Sample 9	Mar-18	131
		
What was the average precipitation for each month?		
		
Jan-18		
Feb-18		
Mar-18		
		
		
Now, calculate the average of the following numbers only with formulas SUM and COUNT (don't use Average formula)		
		
What is the average of all of the samples?		
Now get the same result with Average function		
		
"Question 2) The excel file named Average 3, the table below contains precipitation
measurement as measured in the Rochester NY area last year and we
sampled 3 days in each of the first three months of 2018. Complete all
the question in the file given."

1. Answer) Jan - 18 average  		
For Sum		
433		
For Count		
3		
Average = Sum / Count		
144.3333333		
		
2.Answer) Fab-18 average		
For Sum		
408		
For Count		
3		
Average = Sum / Count		
136		
		
3.Answer) March-18 average		
For Sum		
582		
For Count		
3		
Average = Sum / Count		
194		
		
4) What is the average of all of the samples?		
For Sum		
1423		
For Count		
9		
Average = Sum / Count		
158.1111111		
		
5) Now get the same result with Average function		
158.1111111		

Question 3) count 1

The table below shows survey responses; the respondents could use any value for their answers.

	#DIV/0!
	AAA
	Apple1234
	
	Solve by using formulas COUNT, COUNTA and COUNTBLANK:
	
1	How many cells with a number value are in the grey range (cells B3 to B13)?
ANSWER IS 2 (FORMULA IS  COUNT(B3:B13)	
	2
	
2	How many empty cells are in the grey range?
Aneswe is 4  ( COUNTBLANK(B3:B13))	
4	
3	How many non number cells are in  the grey range?
Answer is 9 (Formula is ROWS(B3:B13) - COUNT(B3:B13)
